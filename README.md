ZX-Spectrum Sound Tracker music player

This is an AY-3-8910 emulator along with a ZX-Spectrum Sound Tracker music player ported to AVR ATtiny85 MCU. There is no need for any external components, the single ATtiny85 chip has everything inside. You just need to power it up with a 5V source and receive the PWM sound output from pin3 (PB1). That's it.
